Microsoft has successfully closed its landmark acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard after a lengthy and contentious regulatory battle. The deal, one of the largest in tech history, gives Microsoft control over major franchises like 'Call of Duty' and 'World of Warcraft.' The closure came after Microsoft made concessions, particularly regarding cloud gaming rights in Europe, to appease regulators. This acquisition significantly bolsters Microsoft's position in the lucrative global gaming market.
