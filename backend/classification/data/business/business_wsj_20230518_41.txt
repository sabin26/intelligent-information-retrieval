The U.S. housing market has become effectively locked, as high mortgage rates are discouraging both buyers and sellers. Potential buyers are priced out by high borrowing costs, leading to a slump in demand. At the same time, existing homeowners who have low-rate mortgages are reluctant to sell and move, as they would face a much higher rate on a new loan. This 'lock-in' effect has severely limited the inventory of homes for sale and created a stagnant market.
