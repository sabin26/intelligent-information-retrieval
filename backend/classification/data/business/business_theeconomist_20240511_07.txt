The initial excitement surrounding green hydrogen as a clean energy solution is now meeting the hard reality of economic and logistical challenges. While touted as a key to decarbonizing heavy industry, the costs of production remain prohibitively high. Furthermore, building the necessary infrastructure for transport and storage requires massive investment and time. These practical hurdles have tempered optimistic forecasts, shifting the focus toward more targeted applications where green hydrogen is most viable.
