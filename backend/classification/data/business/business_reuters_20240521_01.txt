Recent meeting minutes from the Federal Reserve reveal that officials are taking a patient stance on interest rate cuts. Policymakers noted that inflation has been more persistent than anticipated, delaying the timeline for monetary easing. They plan to maintain the current high interest rates for a longer period to ensure inflation moves sustainably toward their 2% target. This cautious approach reflects uncertainty about the economic path and a commitment to preventing a resurgence in price pressures.
