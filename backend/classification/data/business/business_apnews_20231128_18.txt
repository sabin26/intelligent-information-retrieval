Recent data indicates that the U.S. job market is cooling from its previously red-hot pace, but it remains remarkably resilient. While the rate of job growth has slowed, unemployment remains low, and wage gains continue to be solid. This moderation is seen as a positive sign by the Federal Reserve, as it could help ease inflation without triggering a sharp economic downturn. The labor market's durability continues to be a key source of strength for the U.S. economy.
