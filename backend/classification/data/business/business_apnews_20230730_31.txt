Labor unions are experiencing a resurgence in sectors where they have not traditionally been strong, such as retail, food service, and technology. High-profile organizing campaigns at companies like Starbucks and Amazon have inspired workers across various industries. This renewed interest in unionization is driven by concerns over wages, working conditions, and a desire for a greater voice in the workplace. The trend signals a potential shift in the balance of power between labor and corporations.
