The latest inflation report showed that core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, are moderating. This is a positive development for the Federal Reserve in its fight against inflation. The cooling trend suggests that the central bank's policy of raising interest rates is having the intended effect. While overall inflation is not yet at the Fed's target, the data provides hope that the worst of the price surge may be over, potentially allowing for a pause in rate hikes.
