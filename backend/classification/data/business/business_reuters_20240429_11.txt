Oil prices are experiencing significant volatility as the market balances geopolitical risks against concerns about global demand. Tensions in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine create supply-side risks that push prices up. Conversely, worries about a potential economic slowdown, particularly in China and Europe, could dampen demand and pull prices down. This tug-of-war between supply fears and demand concerns is leading to fluctuating prices and an uncertain outlook for the energy market.
