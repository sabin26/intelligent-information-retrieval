The streaming industry has entered a new era defined by fiscal discipline and a focus on profitability. After years of lavish spending on content to attract subscribers, companies like Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. are now cutting costs and raising prices. The 'streaming wars' are less about subscriber growth at all costs and more about building sustainable, profitable businesses. This shift includes crackdowns on password sharing, the introduction of ad-supported tiers, and more selective content investment.
