Regulating medical algorithms and artificial intelligence presents a significant new challenge for agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Unlike traditional medical devices, these algorithms can learn and change over time, making it difficult to ensure their ongoing safety and effectiveness. The FDA is grappling with how to create a regulatory framework that can adapt to this rapidly evolving technology. Key challenges include preventing bias, ensuring transparency, and establishing clear standards for validation and post-market surveillance.
