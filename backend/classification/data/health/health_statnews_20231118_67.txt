The United States is facing a worsening shortage of primary care doctors, which is straining the healthcare system and limiting access to care for many Americans. An aging physician workforce, burnout, and insufficient numbers of medical students choosing primary care are contributing to the problem. This shortage is most acute in rural and underserved communities. The situation leads to delayed diagnoses, poorer management of chronic diseases, and increased costs as patients turn to more expensive emergency care.
