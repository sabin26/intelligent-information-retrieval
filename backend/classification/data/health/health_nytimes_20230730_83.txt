Wearable technology like smartwatches and fitness trackers is transforming personal health monitoring. These devices can now track a wide range of metrics, including heart rate, sleep patterns, blood oxygen levels, and even perform an ECG. This constant stream of data can empower individuals to take a more active role in managing their health and detecting potential issues early. However, it also raises questions about data accuracy, privacy, and the potential for causing unnecessary health anxiety.
