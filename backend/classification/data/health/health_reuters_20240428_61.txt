Gavi, the global vaccine alliance, has issued a warning about the rising risk of large and disruptive measles outbreaks worldwide. A decline in routine childhood immunizations during the COVID-19 pandemic has left millions of children vulnerable to this highly contagious disease. The organization is calling for urgent action from governments to catch up on missed vaccinations and bolster their immunization programs. Failure to do so could lead to a resurgence of measles, a preventable disease that can cause serious illness and death.
