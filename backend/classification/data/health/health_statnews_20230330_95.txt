Researchers have reported a significant breakthrough in the treatment of spinal cord injuries. A new therapy involving electrical stimulation of the spinal cord has enabled some patients with paralysis to regain voluntary movement in their legs. While the research is still in its early stages, the results are highly promising and offer new hope for restoring function after severe spinal cord injuries. The study represents a major step forward in the field of neuroscience and rehabilitation.
