Newly available vaccines for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) have proven to be effective in protecting older adults from the common but potentially severe respiratory illness. Clinical trials showed that the vaccines significantly reduce the risk of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV. RSV can be particularly dangerous for seniors and those with underlying health conditions, often leading to hospitalization. The approval of these vaccines provides an important new tool to protect vulnerable populations.
