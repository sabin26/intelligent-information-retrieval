New studies are revealing that popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy offer broader health benefits beyond weight reduction. Clinical trials have shown that these GLP-1 agonists can also reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes. This discovery is expanding the potential use of these drugs from just obesity treatment to a wider range of preventative care. The findings could have a significant impact on how heart disease and other related conditions are managed.
