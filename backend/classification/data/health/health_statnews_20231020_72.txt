A growing body of research is revealing a strong connection between the health of the gut microbiome and mental well-being. The trillions of bacteria in our digestive system appear to communicate with the brain, influencing mood, stress, and even the risk of conditions like depression and anxiety. This 'gut-brain axis' is a promising new area of research. Scientists are now exploring whether interventions like probiotics and dietary changes could be used to improve mental health by promoting a healthy gut.
