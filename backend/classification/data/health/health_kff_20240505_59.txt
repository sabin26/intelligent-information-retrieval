The end of pandemic-era protections has led to a massive 'unwinding' of Medicaid, resulting in millions of Americans losing their health coverage. States are redetermining eligibility for the program for the first time in three years. Many people are losing coverage due to procedural reasons, such as failing to complete paperwork, even if they are still eligible. This process has had a significant impact on access to care for low-income families and children across the country.
