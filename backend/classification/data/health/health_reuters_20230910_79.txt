The spread of avian flu (H5N1) to a growing number of mammal species is raising concerns among public health officials about the potential for human transmission. While the risk to the general public remains low, each new infection in a mammal provides the virus with an opportunity to adapt and potentially become more transmissible to humans. Scientists are closely monitoring the virus's evolution and calling for increased surveillance in both wild animals and farm populations to mitigate the risk of a future pandemic.
