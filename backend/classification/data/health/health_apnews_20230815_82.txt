The World Health Organization (WHO) and its member states are in the process of negotiating and updating an international treaty on pandemic preparedness and response. The goal is to create a legally binding agreement that ensures a more coordinated and equitable global response to future pandemics. Key negotiation points include rapid information sharing, equitable access to vaccines and treatments, and strengthening health systems worldwide. The treaty aims to apply the hard-learned lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.
