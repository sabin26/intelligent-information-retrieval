Key areas of focus include strengthening global surveillance systems to detect new pathogens early. They also aim to improve supply chains for medical equipment and create more equitable systems for vaccine and treatment distribution. The goal is to build a more resilient global health security architecture to prevent a repeat of the widespread disruption caused by COVID-19.
