Major health organizations have released updated guidelines for cholesterol management, emphasizing a more personalized approach to risk assessment and treatment. The new recommendations place a greater focus on lifestyle factors like diet and exercise as the first line of defense. They also provide clearer guidance on the use of statins and other cholesterol-lowering medications based on an individual's overall cardiovascular risk profile, not just their cholesterol numbers. The goal is to more effectively prevent heart attacks and strokes.
