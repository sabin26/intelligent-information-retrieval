Artificial intelligence holds incredible promise for medical diagnostics, with the potential to detect diseases faster and more accurately. However, this technology also comes with significant perils. These include the risk of AI algorithms inheriting and amplifying human biases, which could worsen health disparities. There are also major concerns about patient privacy, the reliability of the technology, and the lack of clear regulatory frameworks. Successfully navigating these challenges is crucial for harnessing AI's benefits in healthcare.
