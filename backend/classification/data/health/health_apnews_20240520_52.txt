The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a warning about a concerning rise in drug-resistant infections, or 'superbugs,' within U.S. hospitals. These infections are difficult to treat because the bacteria have evolved to resist standard antibiotics. The increase is partly attributed to a lapse in infection control practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC is urging healthcare facilities to redouble their efforts in hygiene and antibiotic stewardship to combat this growing public health threat.
