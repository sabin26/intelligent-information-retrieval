Cancer immunotherapy, which harnesses the body's own immune system to fight cancer, continues to see significant advances. New types of therapies, such as CAR-T cell therapy and personalized cancer vaccines, are showing remarkable success in treating certain types of cancers that were once considered untreatable. Researchers are working to expand the effectiveness of these treatments to more types of cancer and to more patients. This field represents one of the most promising frontiers in oncology.
