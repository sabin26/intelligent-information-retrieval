The issue of the national debt is a source of deep partisan division in Washington. Republicans and Democrats are locked in a contentious debate over how to address the country's rising debt level. Republicans are demanding significant spending cuts as a condition for raising the debt ceiling, a necessary step to avoid a U.S. default. Democrats are insisting on a 'clean' debt ceiling increase without preconditions. This political standoff creates economic uncertainty and risks a major financial crisis.
