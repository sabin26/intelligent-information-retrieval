U.S. government agencies, including the State Department and intelligence community, are working to counter sophisticated foreign disinformation campaigns aimed at influencing American public opinion. Adversaries like Russia and China use social media and state-run news outlets to spread false narratives, sow division, and undermine trust in democratic institutions. The U.S. response involves exposing these campaigns, promoting media literacy, and working with social media companies to combat the spread of disinformation.
