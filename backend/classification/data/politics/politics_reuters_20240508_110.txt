Leaders of the European Union are debating a new package of sanctions against Russia in response to its ongoing war in Ukraine. The discussions are focused on closing loopholes in existing sanctions and targeting sectors that help fund Russia's war effort, such as its energy industry. However, member states have differing views on how far to go, with some countries concerned about the economic impact on their own economies. Reaching a consensus on the new measures remains a challenge.
