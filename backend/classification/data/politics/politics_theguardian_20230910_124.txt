A contentious political fight is being waged over book bans in public schools and libraries across the United States. Conservative groups are challenging hundreds of books, often those dealing with race, gender, and sexuality, arguing they are inappropriate for children. In response, free speech advocates, librarians, and authors are fighting back, arguing that these bans amount to censorship and harm students by limiting their access to diverse perspectives. This issue has become a heated front in the nation's culture wars.
