State legislatures across the country are actively considering and passing new laws related to voting, setting the stage for the 2024 election. Republican-led states are largely focused on enacting stricter voting rules, such as new ID requirements and limitations on mail-in voting, citing concerns about election security. In contrast, Democratic-led states are generally moving to expand voting access by implementing policies like automatic voter registration and more early voting days. These divergent approaches create a patchwork of voting laws across the U.S.
