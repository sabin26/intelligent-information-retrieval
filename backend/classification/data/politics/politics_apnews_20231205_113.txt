A critical aid package for Ukraine has stalled in the U.S. Congress due to a political standoff. Republican lawmakers are blocking the aid, demanding that it be tied to significant changes in U.S. border and immigration policy. The White House and Democrats have so far resisted these demands, leading to a deadlock. This impasse jeopardizes the continued flow of military and financial support to Ukraine at a crucial moment in its war against Russia.
