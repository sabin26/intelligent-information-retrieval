The White House is mapping out an aggressive summer campaign strategy for President Biden, focusing on travel to key swing states. The plan aims to directly communicate the administration's policy accomplishments, particularly on the economy and infrastructure, to voters. This effort is designed to draw a sharp contrast with his opponent and build momentum heading into the fall. The strategy involves a series of official events and campaign rallies intended to maximize local media coverage and engage with key demographic groups.
