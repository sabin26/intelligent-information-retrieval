Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs have become a major political flashpoint in the United States. Conservative activists and politicians are mounting a campaign against DEI initiatives in corporations, universities, and government, arguing they are divisive and discriminatory. Proponents of DEI contend that these programs are essential for addressing systemic inequality and creating more inclusive environments. This debate has become a central front in the nation's broader 'culture wars.'
