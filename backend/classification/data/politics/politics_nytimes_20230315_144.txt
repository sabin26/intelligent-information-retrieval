State attorneys general (AGs) have become powerful and influential figures on the national political stage. Both Democratic and Republican AGs are using their offices to sue the federal government and launch multi-state lawsuits on major policy issues like immigration, environmental regulations, and healthcare. They often act as a check on presidential power and advance their party's agenda through the legal system. This trend has transformed the role of state AGs into one with significant national impact.
