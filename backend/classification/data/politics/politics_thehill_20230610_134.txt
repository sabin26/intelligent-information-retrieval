Recent ethics controversies involving Supreme Court justices have sparked an ongoing and intense debate over judicial ethics and reform. Critics are calling for the Court to adopt a binding code of conduct, similar to what lower court judges must follow. They argue it is necessary to restore public trust in the institution. However, some justices and conservatives have resisted these calls, arguing it would threaten judicial independence. This debate over the Court's accountability is a major political issue.
