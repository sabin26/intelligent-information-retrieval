After weeks of chaos and multiple failed candidates, House Republicans elected Mike Johnson as the new Speaker of the House. His election ended a period of intense infighting and paralysis that had left the chamber unable to conduct business. Johnson, a conservative with a lower public profile than previous candidates, was able to unify the party's warring factions. His speakership marks a new chapter for the House GOP as it attempts to move forward with its legislative agenda.
