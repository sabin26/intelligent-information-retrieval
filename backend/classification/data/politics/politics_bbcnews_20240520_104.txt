The UK Prime Minister has strongly hinted that a general election will be held in the autumn, ruling out a summer poll. This statement is intended to end speculation and provide some clarity on the political timeline. The governing Conservative Party is currently trailing the opposition Labour Party in the polls. The timing of the election is a critical strategic decision for the Prime Minister as he seeks to improve his party's standing before facing the voters.
