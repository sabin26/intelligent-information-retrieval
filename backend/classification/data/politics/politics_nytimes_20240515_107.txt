The Supreme Court is considering a major case that could significantly curtail the power of federal regulatory agencies. The case challenges a long-standing legal precedent known as the 'Chevron deference,' which instructs courts to defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation of ambiguous laws. Overturning this precedent would shift power from the executive branch to the judiciary and could make it much harder for agencies to regulate areas like the environment, public health, and the financial sector.
